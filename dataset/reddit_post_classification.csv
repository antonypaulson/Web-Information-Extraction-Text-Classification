0,[REQ] $300 Loan until Oct 15 - will repay $330,"I was doored by a taxi and was severely injured last week riding home from work. I am unable to work for 2 weeks and my work has sent my pay over to their insurance company Great West Life which has a 4-6 week waiting period for short term disability pay out is 60% of my wage and wont pay out until possibly last week of Sept first week of Oct. I get paid at the end of the month if I am back to work on the 15th but that cheque will need to go towards my rent. I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle. Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

15,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

18,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

61,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

64,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

110,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

156,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

202,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

245,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

248,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

294,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

333,[REQ] $57 loan for three weeks to fix the AC in my car,"The AC in my car recently broke.  I had my dad (who used to be a mechanic) take a look at it and he says it needs a new compressor.

337,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

340,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

383,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

386,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

429,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

432,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

475,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

478,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

521,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

524,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

567,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

570,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

613,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

615,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

616,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

661,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

662,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

707,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened. I have already almost exhausted my options for rides to and from work, and I'm in desperate need of a loan. I can pay back $120 with two payments of $60, the first on Sept. 12th, and the second on the 26th. My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back. I really really hate asking for loans like this, but it's my last option right now. Please help me out guys :( I have $2 in my bank account and $.73 in pocket change right now. Any help is appreciated! 

Edit: I'm located in west central Wisconsin, about a half hour from the border with Minnesota.

708,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.

753,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened. I have already almost exhausted my options for rides to and from work, and I'm in desperate need of a loan. I can pay back $120 with two payments of $60, the first on Sept. 12th, and the second on the 26th. My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back. I really really hate asking for loans like this, but it's my last option right now. Please help me out guys :( I have $2 in my bank account and $.73 in pocket change right now. Any help is appreciated!

754,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

799,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened. I have already almost exhausted my options for rides to and from work, and I'm in desperate need of a loan. I can pay back $120 with two payments of $60, the first on Sept. 12th, and the second on the 26th. My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back. I really really hate asking for loans like this, but it's my last option right now. Please help me out guys :( I have $2 in my bank account and $.73 in pocket change right now. Any help is appreciated! 

Edit: I'm located in west central Wisconsin, about a half hour from the border with Minnesota. 

Edit2: We've deducted that it's the starter that's the problem, not the battery. My uncle has loaned me the money for a starter, though, and our housemate will be installing it for free! Thanks for the suggestions guys, but I no longer require your assistance :)",cc
800,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle. Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).

They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).

846,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.

Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.

Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.

Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

989,[REQ] $300 Loan until Oct 15 - will repay $330,"I was doored by a taxi and was severely injured last week riding home from work. I am unable to work for 2 weeks and my work has sent my pay over to their insurance company Great West Life which has a 4-6 week waiting period for short term disability pay out is 60% of my wage and wont pay out until possibly last week of Sept first week of Oct. I get paid at the end of the month if I am back to work on the 15th but that cheque will need to go towards my rent. I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle. Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1007,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make.

I am unable to work for 2 weeks and my work has sent my pay over to their insurance company Great West Life which has a 4-6 week waiting period for short term disability pay out is 60% of my wage and wont pay out until possibly last week of Sept first week of Oct. I get paid at the end of the month if I am back to work on the 15th but that cheque will need to go towards my rent. I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle. Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1053,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you.

1081,[REQ] $300 Loan until Oct 15 - will repay $330,"I was doored by a taxi and was severely injured last week riding home from work. I am unable to work for 2 weeks and my work has sent my pay over to their insurance company Great West Life which has a 4-6 week waiting period for short term disability pay out is 60% of my wage and wont pay out until possibly last week of Sept first week of Oct. I get paid at the end of the month if I am back to work on the 15th but that cheque will need to go towards my rent. I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle. Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1099,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1127,[REQ] $300 Loan until Oct 15 - will repay $330,"I was doored by a taxi and was severely injured last week riding home from work. I am unable to work for 2 weeks and my work has sent my pay over to their insurance company Great West Life which has a 4-6 week waiting period for short term disability pay out is 60% of my wage and wont pay out until possibly last week of Sept first week of Oct. I get paid at the end of the month if I am back to work on the 15th but that cheque will need to go towards my rent. I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle. Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1145,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

I am unable to work for 2 weeks and my work has sent my pay over to their insurance company Great West Life which has a 4-6 week waiting period for short term disability pay out is 60% of my wage and wont pay out until possibly last week of Sept first week of Oct. I get paid at the end of the month if I am back to work on the 15th but that cheque will need to go towards my rent. I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle.

1188,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1191,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

I can likely payback sooner than the 15th of Oct as the insurance company will be sending me money, but I put the 15th just in case they don't so I can repay you out of my work paycheck.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday).

Someone is off sick injured you don;t pay them send it to their insurance company who will pay you, provided you paid your dues, so basically this $86 makes or breaks if I get my insurance money back for being off.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1237,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1283,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1329,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1372,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1375,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1418,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1421,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1464,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1467,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1510,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1513,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1556,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1558,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1559,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1602,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1604,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1605,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1648,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1651,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1694,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1697,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1736,[REQ] $57 loan for three weeks to fix the AC in my car,"The AC in my car recently broke.  I had my dad (who used to be a mechanic) take a look at it and he says it needs a new compressor.  He found the exact part I need and I'm about $55 short of being able to purchase it.  I am paid bi-weekly and my next paycheck will go 100% towards bills so the earliest I'm able to have this fixed is three weeks from now.  It is damn hot and humid here so three weeks of this will be Hell.

I am requesting a loan of $57 to have this replaced immediately(hopefully tomorrow, if I get the loan.)  I can pay it back in three weeks, on September 26th with 10% interest ($6.)

Edit: Wanted to add that I have a steady job that I've been at for several years.  On my previous /r/assistance request thread a couple weeks ago I offered various services in exchange for $15, namely general computer help/troubleshooting and Python programming.  I would definitely be willing to do any of these things in exchange for some or all of the amount that I'm requesting for this loan.  If it's a small enough job I'd be willing to do it in lieu of paying interest, and I'd finish it before you sent the loan.   I'm really desperate to get this AC fixed so I'm willing to try to work out whatever arrangement will get me this loan.",cc

1740,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1742,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1743,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account.

1786,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1788,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1789,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle.

1832,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1834,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1835,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle.

1878,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1880,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1881,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1924,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1926,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back.

1927,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

1970,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

1972,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

1973,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

2016,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

2018,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back.

2019,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account.

2062,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

2064,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back.

2065,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

2108,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

2110,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

2111,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

2154,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

2156,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

2157,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account. The $300 will be used for food, to pay my $60 cell bill, and transit money to get to my doctor and work and for prescriptions. (I am back to work on the 15th maybe sooner I see my doctor on Tuesday). Edit: I also have to pay my human resources deparment $86 so I do not lose my benefits from work since they are not paying me they cannot take it off of my paycheck mid month so they asked that I send a cheque to them, what a debaccle.

2200,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

2202,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back.

2203,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

After I paid rent this month I had no left over money. I have $30 in my account.

2246,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!

2248,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened.

2249,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school.

due to some issues with my landlord about when he's supposed to cash my rent check (since he can't be bothered to read a date on a check), things came up a little shorter than i had budgeted for. i'm a very active member of this sub because i'd rather my interest money went to actual people who want to help instead of some corporation that couldn't care less if i live or die. i try to help other users here as much as i can, and while it's not as much as i want it to be, hopefully in the future i'll be able to do more. the only times i've ever required an extension, i've compensated the lenders for their time and patience, but i do pay back early when i can. feel free to check my [paid] posts if you're curious about me. =) 

i live in astoria, NY. thanks for being who you are and doing what you do! 

edit: this loan is being fulfilled. the lender is going to claim it with the bot later tonight.  ",cc

2292,"[REQ] $1200 to pay for Rent, Electric, Water, Food.","Hello,

My family is in need of $1000-1200.  This money is essential for us to survive.  I have a Fiance and a daughter that is 2 years old.  We currently live in South Carolina.

Recently I lost my job for the bank that I was working for.  The reason that I was terminated from the company was due to the fact that I broke a company policy(Which I was unaware of).  Basically the bank location that I was at previously (As a Roving or Mobile Teller) was a smaller, slower branch.  Near the end of the day I would always go ahead and balance my til and write it down, so when I was ready to close my til I could just enter my totals and clock out.  Since I was not actually counting my money and just entering in the totals that I had counted out, before the bank closed the doors, they considered it force balancing.  They have zero tolerance for this policy, so I received no warning.  I was fired on spot.  I didn't receive any pension and only half of a paycheck (for one week of work).  I have now been unemployed for one month and have not been able to receive unemployment or EBT from the state.

My Fiance does not make enough money to get us through all of the bills.  I have found a job, but will not be starting until the 15th of this month.  I will be making two more dollars an hour than I was at the bank($15), so I am very excited.  But for now and until the end of this month...I still need assistance.  

Starting with my new job on the 15th of this month I will be making around $1200 each paycheck (Bi-Weekly).  My Fiance gets payed commission (Bi-Weekly) and her checks will always be $1000+(Normally 1200-1500, but increases as business does), never any less.  Upon someone offering to help, we can arrange the payments to make sure all works out.  I can provide any information that is needed, including personal!


Thank you,
Ryan",cc

2294,[REQ] $110 for a new car battery.,"The battery in my car died last night at work, so we tried jump starting it and nothing happened. I have already almost exhausted my options for rides to and from work, and I'm in desperate need of a loan. I can pay back $120 with two payments of $60, the first on Sept. 12th, and the second on the 26th. My car is sitting in the parking lot at work right now, and my boss isn't letting me leave it there past tomorrow, as he'll have it towed, which would be more money I don't have to get it back. I really really hate asking for loans like this, but it's my last option right now. Please help me out guys :( I have $2 in my bank account and $.73 in pocket change right now. Any help is appreciated! 

Edit: I'm located in west central Wisconsin, about a half hour from the border with Minnesota. 

Edit2: We've deducted that it's the starter that's the problem, not the battery. My uncle has loaned me the money for a starter, though, and our housemate will be installing it for free! Thanks for the suggestions guys, but I no longer require your assistance :)",cc
2295,[REQ] Struggling to come up with $1300 to finish last quarter of school.,"Hello Redditors!

I am in need of some temporary financial assistance. I have been out of school for 4 years, with only 5 credits left to finish my Bachelor's degree. I came across an opportunity to apply for a grant for women returning to school after a gap in their education. In order to qualify I had to be re-enrolled in school. So I spent the $160 on getting re-enrolled at the University of Washington. 

Unfortunately, I just found out that while I did get the grant, they were unable to grant the full amount requested. They were able to grant $700. Unfrotunatly the tuition costs have become astronomical at the UW and just a single 5 credit class, tuition and required fees comes to $2,100. Because it 5 credits is not even part time enrollment, and because my Fafsa was filled out after February 15th of 2014 (at that point I did not even imagine I might be able to go back to school) UW deemed me ineligible for financial assistance. 


I would really like to finish school this fall so I can apply for a job teaching english in Japan, which pays a good 10,000 more a year  than I currently make. 

I know $100-$150 a month is not a lot compared to the $1300 that i need to procure, but I am willing to pay interest on top of that, if someone is willing to work with me. 

I am continuing to seek other options and trying to find assistance with my family and friends, but so far I have had no luck. My mom is permanently disabled and my aunt unfortunately has to pay the IRS money each month due to her ex husband running their business to the ground and then skipping out on the payments. 

Due to that same business being run into the ground (I used to be employed there) my credit is also shot from helping my family stay afloat at that time. 

If you would like additional information on the circumstances, I would love to provide it to you. 

My tuition is due October 10th, but school starts  Sept 24th, so unfortunately I do not have a lot of time to try to come up with this. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

    The exact amount you need: $1300

    When you'll be able to pay it back: until I procure a second job or a new job I can manage $100 - $150 a month

    What you want to spend it on: Finishing my last quarter of school. 

    Where you are: Bellevue, WA
